Notes on Programs
The files named BEAM program, HARMON program, PLANE program and NONLIN program are the electronic versions of the four programs listed and described in detail in the book Finite Element Methods for Engineers, Second Edition, by Roger T. Fenner.  In the cases of HARMON, PLANE and NONLIN, multiple versions of subprograms MESH and MODIFY (all of which are explained in the book) are included.  Before attempting to compile any of these three, the appropriate versions of MESH and MODIFY for the problem in hand should be selected, and the other versions deleted.  In the case of program NONLIN, the relevant form of nonlinear modulus function also needs to be coded in subprogram ENONLIN.
